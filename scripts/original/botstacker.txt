// Botstacker
// by Tollski
// 
// The key for each sub-section represents the count of real players on the player team.
//
// The formula for how many bots are allowed by the plugin is based on whether the server's capacity is odd or even.
//   If the server's capacity is even, the formula is: BotCount <= ServerCapacity - PlayerCount - 2.
//   If the server's capacity is odd, the formula is: BotCount <= ServerCapacity - PlayerCount - 1.
//   Examples:
//     With a 16-slot server, if there is 1 player online you can have up to 13 bots (16 - 1 - 2 = 13).
//     With a 15-slot server, if there is 1 player online you can have up to 13 bots (15 - 1 - 1 = 13).
